## CRUD APLICATION

<p>
  This is a small presentation of what this application can do. It's a basic CRUD that simulates the typical login 🔑, a registration for new users 👥, and some screens that will allow modifying and deleting the user ✏️🗑️. It also includes an admin interface where the administrator 👨‍💼 can modify each person's data, as well as create new users and delete them.

<p>
  This is the home screen! 🏠 You can either log in 🔐 or create an account ✨ if you're new here!

  Already have an account? Perfect! ✅

You can now log in on this screen by entering your username 👤 and password 🔑.

🔹 If you’re an admin, you’ll be taken to the Admin Dashboard 🛠️, where you can manage the system.
🔹 If you’re a regular user, you’ll access your Account Profile 👀, where you can view and edit your personal details.
